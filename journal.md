Started looking at deep neural nets, getting an error for
important isotopes (u-235, 238, pu-239) at around 18%.

Playing with number of layers and nodes in the hidden layer.
Looking at physics-based-neural-networks on separating
isotopes by category (FP, MA, Fissile etc) to improve
performance.

*Thought: maybe just lump all isotopes to FP, MA, and U235, 238, Pu239?*
